1. Get pubsub message (JSON)
2. Validate the message
3. Call a bunch of APIs to process the message (fake io task)
4. Publish results to a different pubsub topic


TODO:

- Debug Nacker, hangs the app when terminating
- Logger is blocking, use aiologger? Seems abandoned though
- Write a bit of tests
- A way to track how many messages are getting processed
- Complete message processing bit to generate meaningful output
